# Mediator

(this readme is a work in progress)

Mediator is a small, standalone service for efficient image processing. Images are processed on the fly with `libvips` and cached by CDN. The service is intended as a replacement for all common image operations in your web apps.

You can use it to:

- **Resize images.** Generate thumbnails and responsive images on the fly.
- **Crop images**. crop images (currently only smart crop is supported).
- **Apply effects**. Apply filters to images (currently only `pixelate` is supported).
- **Proxy media files**: proxy images and other files behind secure, signed URLs.
- **Strip metadata**. Remove metadata from images to reduce file size and protect user privacy.

Examples:

## Features

- **Fast**. Written in Go, uses `libvips`, for image processing.
- **Simple**. A small web service with minimal configuration.
- **Secure**. Supports signed URLs and authentication tokens.
- **Easy to integrate**. Works with any CDN and storage provider.
- **Easy to deploy**. Just use the provided Docker image.
- **Most common image operations**. Resize, crop, apply effects, and more.
- **Auto WebP**. Auto-convert images to WebP and serve them to browsers that support it.

## Installation

Mediator is distributed as a docker image:

```shell
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env --publish 8000:8000 ghcr.io/pch/mediator:latest
```

### Caching

Mediator is does not offer a built-in cache and will re-download images on each request. The service is intended to run behind a CDN that will cache the processed images.

## Usage

## Configuration

Mediator can be configured using `ENV` variables:
